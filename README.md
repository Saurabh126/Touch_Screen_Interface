# Touch Screen Interface
This project aims to create an interface, that can detect hand movement and track gestures, thereby enabling some Touch-Screen Functionality in a non-Touch Screen environment.
This project in currently in a very nascent stage.
As of now we can detect the movement of a specific colour (Blue) in the Webcam.
